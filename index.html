                            remains 427 °C. The special thing about the atmosphere of Mercury is that its atmosphere is

                            named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It is the brightest natural object in the
                            night sky after the Moon. Its apparent {magnitude reaches} -4.6 and is bright enough to cast
                            a shadow. Since Venus is an inferior planet, it is never seen far from the Sun as seen

                            Venus is classified as a terrestrial planet and is sometimes referred to as Earth's "sister
                            planet" because of their similar size, gravity, and composition. Venus is closest to Earth
                            in both size and distance. Although in other respects it looks very different from the
                            Earth. Venus is covered with an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds containing sulfuric
                            acid. Which has kept its surface from being observed from space in visible light. Its
                            atmosphere is the densest of the four terrestrial planets and is composed mostly of carbon
                            dioxide. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of the planet is 92 times that of Earth.
                            With an average surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C, 863 °F), Venus is by far the hottest
                            planet in the Solar System. There is no carbon cycle present here to fix the carbon back
                            into the rocks and surface landforms, and no organic life appears here to absorb the
                            protoplasm. Venus may have had oceans in the past, but they would have evaporated with
                            increasing temperatures due to a continuing greenhouse effect. The water most likely
                            occurred through photodissociation, and, therefore, of the planetary magnetic field. Because
                            of the scarcity, free hydrogen has been blown into interplanetary space by the solar wind.
                            [16] The land of Venus is a dry desert of scattered boulders and is periodically refreshed
                            by volcanism. Visionary research in 2020 found evidence of phosphine gas in its atmosphere,
                            which is re-imagining the possibility of life on Venus.

                              In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's magnetic field to be much weaker than Earth's. This
                              magnetic field is driven by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind,
                              rather than an internal dynamo, as in Earth's inner core. Venus's small induced

                              The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field on Venus, despite being comparable in size to
                              Earth, was surprising. It was also expected that its core houses a dynamo. A dynamo needs
                              three things: a conducting fluid, rotation, and convection. The core is assumed to be
                              electrically conductive, while its rotation is often assumed to be too slow, simulations
                              show that this is sufficient to produce a dynamo. This implies that the dynamo is
                              missing. Because Venus lacks convection in its core. On Earth, convection occurs in the
                              outer layers of the core because the liquid layer at the bottom is much hotter than the
                              top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and caused a
                              reduction of heat flow through the crust. This induced the mantle temperature to rise,
                              increasing the flow of heat out of the core. Consequently, there is no internal geodynamo
                              available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, thermal energy released from the core has
                              been repeatedly used to reheat the crust.

                            cold, so the entire liquid portion of the core is at roughly the same temperature. Another
                            possibility is that its core is already completely solidified. The state of the core is
                            strongly dependent on the sulfur concentration, which is currently unknown.

                            The weak magnetic envelope around Venus means that the solar wind interacts directly with
                            the planet's outer atmosphere. Here, hydrogen and oxygen ions are formed by dissociation of
                            neutral molecules released by ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy
                            that gives some of these ions sufficient velocity to escape from the planet's magnetic
                            field. This erosion process results in the loss of low-mass hydrogen, helium, and oxygen
                            ions, while retaining much of the higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, in the same
                            way. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind probably caused the greatest loss of water during
                            the billions of years following the planet's formation. This erosion has increased the ratio
                            of high-mass deuterium to low-mass hydrogen in the upper atmosphere to 150 times that in the
                            lower atmosphere.

                              mi), completing one revolution every 224.65 days. Although all planetary orbits are
                              elliptical, the orbit of Venus is closer to circular, with an eccentricity of less than
                              0.01. When Venus lies between the Earth and the Sun, this condition is called inferior
                              conjunction, which characterizes its orbit. This makes it the closest approach to Earth,
                              with the other planets being at an average distance of 41 million km. Venus reaches
                              inferior conjunction every 584 days on average. Due to the decreasing eccentricity of
                              Earth's orbit, this minimum distance is tens of thousands. After one year it will be
                              maximum. From Year 1 to 5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million km, then no

                              counterclockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise (called "retrograde" rotation)
                              once every 243 Earth days, the slowest rotation period of any planet. Thus a Venus
                              sidereal day lasts longer than a Venus year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). The equatorial

                            perturbations have led to its present position. This change which must have happened after a
                            process of billions of years. Venus's rotation period probably reflects a state of
                            equilibrium between tidal forcing from the Sun's gravity, which tends to slow rotation, and
                            an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the dense Venusian atmosphere. An

                            more sightings were reported. But most were determined to be nearby stars. At the California
                            Institute of Technology, a 2006 study of models on the early Solar System by Alex Elmi and
                            David Stevenson suggested that Venus had at least one moon like ours, which was formed by a
                            large collisional event billions of years ago. About 10 million years later, another
                            collision reversed the planet's rotation direction. This caused the rotation or orbit of the
                            Moon of Venus to gradually contract inward until it collided with Venus and merged with it.

                              Venus's orbit is slightly inclined relative to Earth's orbit; Therefore, when the planet
                              passes between the Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the Sun's face. Transiting
                              Venus is found when the planet's inferior conjunction coincides with its appearance in
                              Earth's orbital plane. Transits of Venus occur in cycles of 243 years. In the current
                              pattern of transits, the first two transits occur at intervals of eight years, then a long
                              pause of about 105.5 years or 121.5 years, and again a period of new transit pairs at
                              eight-year intervals. This form was first discovered by the English astronomer Jeremiah
                              Horrocks in 1639.

                              is a subtle illumination of the dark side of Venus and is visible when the planet is in a
                              crescent phase. The first sighting of this light was claimed as early as 1643, but the
                              existence of the light has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may
                              result from lightning activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but this can be misleading.
                              This may be the result of an illusion of seeing a bright, crescent-shaped object.

                              its 109-day orbit transfer on 14 December 1962, it became the world's first successful
                              interplanetary mission to pass Venus 34,883 km above Earth. Its microwave and infrared
                              radiometers showed that the uppermost clouds of Venus were cool, while earlier
                              ground-based measurements confirmed Venus's surface temperature to be extremely hot (425
                              °C), and eventually this expectation. It was concluded that this planet could be home

                              but was unable to detect the magnetic field or radiation belts.

Although it failed in its mission to measure the atmosphere of Venus, it became the first human-made object to touch the surface of another planet. Unfortunately, a malfunction prevented it from transmitting any scientific data to Venus.

                                3</a> spacecraft crashed while landing on Venus on March 1, 1966. It was the first
                              man-made object to enter the atmosphere and collide with the surface of another planet.
                              Even though its communication system failed, it was able to transmit all the planetary
                              data before that. On 18 October 1967, Venera 4 successfully entered the atmosphere
                              and deployed several scientific instruments. Venera 4 reported surface temperatures higher
                              than the nearly 500 °C maximum measured by Mariner 2, and showed the atmosphere to be
                              about 90 to 95% carbon dioxide. Venus's atmosphere was much denser than had been estimated
                              by the designers of Venera 4. This made the parachute slower than the scheduled time to
                              descend. This meant that the vehicle's batteries would run out before reaching the
                              surface. After transmitting descent data for 93 minutes, Venera 4's last pressure reading
                              at an altitude of 24.96 km was 18 bar.

                              A day later, on 19 October 1967, Mariner 5 conducted a pass at an altitude of less than
                              4000 km above the cloud tops. Actually Mariner 5 was originally built as a backup for
                              Mariner 4 connected to Mars. But when the mission was successful, the vehicle was
                              converted for Venus mission. Its pair of instruments were more sensitive than those on
                              Mariner 2. In particular, its radio occultation experiment transmitted data on the
                              composition, pressure, and density of the atmosphere of Venus. The combined data
                              from Venera 4-Mariner 5 were presented by a joint Soviet-American science team in a series
                              of formal talks the following year. It is an early example of space

                              May in the same year under the guise of a day. The vehicle was strengthened by increasing
                              its crush pressure limit to 25 bar and equipped with a smaller parachute to achieve a
                              faster descent. Later, more recent atmospheric models of Venus suggested the surface
                              pressure to be between 75 and 100 bar. Therefore there was no hope of survival of these
                              vehicles on the surface. After transmitting atmospheric data for a short interval of 50
                              minutes, both probes disintegrated at an altitude of about 20 km before hitting the
                              surface of the night side of Venus.

                            ejected by nova stars. At about 4.6 Ga, the solar nebula began to shrink, possibly due

                            started. Gradually, as the cloud increased its rotation speed, due to gravity and inertia,
                            it was transformed into the shape of a microplanetary disc, which was perpendicular to its
                            axis of rotation. Most of its mass was concentrated in its center and began to heat up, but
                            the angular momentum and collisions of other large debris created micro-interruptions, which
                            created a medium through which asteroids of several kilometers in length could be formed.

                          these rocks has shown that the age of the Moon is 4527 ± 10 million years, which is about
                          30 to 55 million years younger than other bodies in the Solar System. (New evidence
                          suggests that suggests that the Moon may have formed even later, 4.48±0.02 Ga, or 70-110 Ma,

                          density, which must have meant that it was relatively dense. It must be that it does not have
                          a large metallic core, as is the case with the celestial bodies of the Solar System. The Moon
                          is composed of such substances, whose mantle and upper surface are much more than that of the
                          Earth, without the center of the Earth. This gave rise to the giant impact hypothesis,

                          material ejected by an explosion on the surface of the ancient Earth and the impacting planet

                          The impactor, sometimes called Theia, is thought to have been slightly smaller in size than
                          present-day Mars. It is possible that it was formed by the accumulation of matter at their
                          fourth or fifth Lagrangian point, 150 million kilometers away from the Sun and Earth. Its
                          orbit may have been stable initially, but as Theia began to gain mass due to the accumulation
                          of matter, it would have become unbalanced. Theia's rotation around the Lagrangian point
                          increased, and it eventually collided with Earth around 4.533 Ga.[nb 1] Models show that
                          when an impacting planet of this size moves at a low angle and relatively slowly collided with
                          the proto-Earth at a speed (8-20 km/s), most of the material ejected from the inner crust and
                          outer shells of the proto-Earth and impact planet was ejected into space, where most of it
                          remained in orbit around the Earth. Stayed. Eventually this material formed the Moon. However,
                          the metallic elements of the impacting planet combined with Earth's elements to move beneath
                          its surface, leaving the Moon devoid of metallic elements. The giant impact hypothesis
                          thus explains the Moon's unusual composition. It is possible that the ejected material in
                          orbit around the Earth may have condensed into a single body within two weeks. Under the
                          influence of its own gravity, this ejected material coalesced into a more spheroidal body: the
                          Moon.

                          intense and in the absence of an ozone layer to block the penetration of ultraviolet
                          radiation, it must have been abundant at the surface.

                          Mantle convection, the process that drives present-day plate tectonics, results in the flow of
                          heat from the center to the Earth's surface. This involves the formation of rigid tectonic
                          plates at mid-oceanic ridges. These plates are destroyed by subduction in the upper mantle at
                          subduction zones. Earth's interior was warmer during the Hadean and Archean epochs, so
                          convection must have been more intense at the upper surface. When a process like the current
                          plate tectonics would have occurred, it would have increased its speed even more. Most
                          geologists believe that during the Hadean and Archean, subduction zones were more common and
                          therefore tectonic plates were smaller in size.

                          contain sedimentary particles that have been rounded by wear during transport by water,

                          Cratons are mainly made up of two alternating types of geographical structures (terranes). The
                          first are the so-called greenstone slabs, which are formed from low-quality metamorphosed
                          sedimentary rocks. These "greenstones" are similar to sediments currently found in oceanic
                          trenches, above subduction zones. This is why greenstone is sometimes seen as an evidence of
                          subduction during the Archean. The second type is a mixture of sandy magmatic rocks. These
                          rocks are mostly tonalite, trondzemite or granodiorite, which are granite-like texture rocks
                          (hence such geological formations are called TTG-terranes). TTG-mixtures are seen as remnants
                          of the first continental crust, which were formed by partial melting of basalt. The
                          alternation between greenstone plates and TTG-mixtures is interpreted as a tectonic situation
                          in which small proto-continents were separated by an exhaustive network of subducting zones.

                            components came to Earth from space (see "Panspermia"), while the other argues that they

                            originated around 4 Ga. It is possible that life arose and died more than once during
                            the same period due to the continuous formation and destruction of oceans by high-energy
                            asteroid bombardments.

                            In the energetic chemistry of the early Earth, one molecule acquired the ability to make
                            copies of itself—a replicator. (More correctly, it encouraged chemical reactions that
                            produced copies of themselves.) The copy was not always perfect: some copies differed
                            slightly from their parents.

                            not produce any copies and the line was "ended". On the other hand, some rare mutations
                            could improve or speed up the copying ability of the molecule: those "breeds" proliferated
                            and became "successful". This is an early example of evolution on inorganic matter. The

                            growing to a lower energy state, allowed an early method of natural selection. When
                            alternatives to raw materials ("food") ran out, breeds could use different substances, or
                            possibly steal the resources of other breeds, stunting their growth, and become more

                            copyist might have evolved. Various replicators have been considered, including biological
                            chemicals such as modern proteins, nucleic acids, phospholipids, crystals, or even
                            quantum systems. There is as yet no way of determining whether Do any of these models
                            closely correlate with the origin of life on Earth?

                            an example of how this might have happened. Volcanism, lightning, and ultraviolet radiation
                            can drive chemical reactions that can produce more complex molecules from simple compounds
                            such as methane and ammonia.:38 Many of these were simpler organic compounds, including
                            nucleobases. And amino acids are also included, which are the basic building blocks of life.
                            As the volume and concentration of this "biological soup" increased, interactions began to
                            occur between the different molecules. Sometimes this resulted in more complex
                            molecules—perhaps the soil provided a framework for organic material to collect and

                            called enzymes took over the role of catalysts, so that RNA had only to transfer
                            information, synthesize proteins, And the only task left was to regulate this process. There

                            The earliest cells were probably heterotrophs and used organic molecules around them
                            (including those of other cells) as raw materials and as a source of energy. As
                            As food supplies dwindled, some cells developed a new strategy. Instead of relying on the
                            exhausting amounts of freely available organic molecules, these cells adapted to sunlight as
                            a source of energy. Although estimates differ, by about 3 Ga, something similar to
                            present-day oxygenic synthesis had probably developed, making the Sun's energy available not
                            only to the autotrophs, but also to the heterotrophs that feed on them. This type
                            of synthesis, which had by then become the most common, used the abundant carbon dioxide and
                            water as raw materials and, with the energy of sunlight, converted energy-rich organic
                            molecules (carbohydrates) used to generate

                            In addition, oxygen was excreted as a waste product of this synthesis. First, it bound
                            with limestone, iron, and other minerals. There is ample evidence of this in the
                            iron-oxide-rich strata found in geological layers from this period. The reaction of minerals
                            with oxygen would have given the oceans a green colour. When most of the quickly reacting
                            minerals that were exposed were oxidized, oxygen eventually began to accumulate in the
                            atmosphere. Although each cell produced only a small amount of oxygen, the combined
                            metabolism of many cells over a very long period of time transformed the Earth's atmosphere
                            to its present state. The most ancient examples of oxygen-producing bioforms
                            include fossil stromatolites. This was the third atmosphere of the earth.

                            Encouraged by incoming ultraviolet radiation, some of the oxygen was converted into ozone,
                            which accumulated in a layer in the upper part of the atmosphere. The ozone layer absorbed a
                            large amount of ultraviolet radiation that once penetrated the atmosphere, and it continues
                            to do so today. This allowed cells to form colonies on the surface of the oceans, eventually
                            on land: Without the ozone layer, ultraviolet radiation bombarding the surface would
                            have caused unsustainable levels of mutation in exposed cells.

                            The oxygen-rich atmosphere had two main advantages for life. Organisms that do not use
                            oxygen for their metabolism, such as anaerobic bacteria, make fermentation the basis of
                            their metabolism. The abundance of oxygen makes respiration possible, a much more efficient
                            energy source for life than fermentation. Another advantage of an oxygen-rich atmosphere is
                            that oxygen forms ozone in the higher atmosphere, giving rise to Earth's ozone layer. The
                            ozone layer protects the Earth's surface from life-threatening ultraviolet radiation.
                            Without this ozone layer, the later development of more complex life would probably have
                            been impossible.

                            The natural evolution of the Sun made it progressively brighter during the Archean and
                            Proterozoic eras; The Sun's luminosity increases by 6% every 10 million years. As a
                            result, Earth received more heat from the Sun during the Proterozoic Era. However, this did
                            not make the earth warmer. Instead, the geological record seems to indicate that it cooled
                            dramatically during the early Proterozoic Era. Glacial deposits found on all cratons
                            indicate that around 2.3 Ga, the first ice age on Earth occurred (the Macagnean ice
                            age). Some scientists believe that this and the subsequent Proterozoic ice ages were so
                            severe that they caused the planet to freeze completely from the poles to the equator, a
                            concept known as Snowball Earth. Not all geologists agree with this scenario, and earlier,
                            Archaean ice ages have been hypothesized, but the 2.3 Ga ice age is the first such event for
                            which the evidence is widely accepted.

                          The direct cause of the 2.3 Ga ice age may have been the increased amount of oxygen in the
                          atmosphere, which reduced the amount of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere. Methane is a potent
                          greenhouse gas, but oxygen reacts with it to form CO2, which is a less effective greenhouse
                          gas. When free oxygen became available in the atmosphere, the density of methane
                          decreased dramatically. It must have been enough to withstand the increasing flow of heat
                          coming from the Sun.

                            is unknown. The bacterial realm was probably the first to separate from other forms of life
                            (sometimes called Neomura), but this hypothesis is disputed. Shortly thereafter, by 2
                            Ga, the Neomura split into Archaea and Eukarya. Eukaryotic cells (Eukarya) are larger
                            and more complex than prokaryotic cells (Bacteria and Archaea) and the origins of that

                            By this time, the early proto-mitochondrion had formed. A bacterial cell belonging to the
                            extant Rickettsia which had learned to metabolize oxygen, entered a larger prokaryotic
                            cell, which did not have that capability. Presumably the larger cell attempted to consume
                            the smaller cell, but (possibly due to the evolution of defensiveness in prey) the attempt
                            failed. The smaller cell may have tried to become a parasite of the larger cell. In any
                            case, the smaller cell survived the larger cell. Using oxygen, it metabolized the waste
                            materials of the larger cell and obtained more energy. Some of its excess energy was
                            returned to the host. The smaller cell was copied inside the larger cell. Soon, a stable
                            symbiosis developed between the larger cell and the smaller cells within it. Over time, the
                            host cell took up some of the genes of the smaller cell, and the two types became dependent
                            on each other: the larger cell could not survive without the energy produced by the smaller
                            cells, and the smaller, on the other hand, Cells could not survive without the raw materials
                            provided by the larger cell. The whole cell is now considered a single organism and smaller
                            cells are classified as organelles called mitochondria.

                            a supercontinent, after which the supercontinent disintegrated and new continents drifted
                            apart again. This repetition of tectonic events is called the Wilson cycle. The further back
                            in time we go, the more rare and difficult the data becomes to interpret. At least it is
                            clear that from about 1000 to 830 Ma, most of the continental mass was organized into the
                            supercontinent Rodinia. It is very likely that Rodinia was not the first
                            supercontinent, and several older supercontinents have been proposed. This means that
                            processes such as present-day plate tectonics were active during the Proterozoic as well.

                          After the disintegration of Rodinia around 800 Ma, it is possible that the continents were
                          reunited around 500 Ma. This hypothetical supercontinent is sometimes called Panocia or
                          Vendia. Evidence of this is a phase of continental collision, called the Pan-African orogeny,
                          in which the continental masses of present-day Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia
                          were combined. However, it is more likely that the aggregation of continental masses was not
                          complete, as a supercontinent called Laurentia (roughly the size of present-day North America)
                          had begun to break apart around 610 Ma. . At least this much is certain that by the end of the
                          Proterozoic Era, most of the continental mass remained organized in a position around the
                          South Pole.

                            The end of the Proterozoic Era saw at least two snowball earths, which were so severe that
                            the surface of the oceans may have been completely frozen. This occurred in the Cryogenian
                            period, around 710 and 640 Ma. The severe glaciations are less easy to explain than the
                            early Proterozoic Snowball Earth. Most paleoclimatologists believe that these cold events
                            have some connection with the formation of the supercontinent Rodinia. As Rodinia was
                            centered on the equator, rates of chemical weathering increased and carbon dioxide (CO2) was
                            removed from the atmosphere. Since CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, climates have cooled
                            all over the Earth.

                            Similarly, during Snowball Earth, much of the continental surface was permanently frozen
                            (permafrost), which again reduced chemical weathering, ending glaciation. An alternative
                            hypothesis is that volcanic eruptions released enough carbon dioxide that the resulting
                            greenhouse effect raised global temperatures. Around the same time the disintegration
                            of Rodinia led to an increase in volcanic activity.

                            The Ediacaran period was followed by the Cryogenia period, which is characterized by the
                            rapid development of new multicellular organisms. It is not yet clear if there is a
                            connection between the severe ice ages and the increase in the diversity of life, but it
                            does not appear to be coincidental. The new forms of life, called the Ediacara biota, were
                            the largest and most diverse forms up to that time. Most scientists believe that some of
                            them may have been precursors to new forms of life in the later Cambrian period. Although
                            the taxonomy of most Ediacaran organisms is unclear, it has been proposed that some of them
                            were the ancestors of modern life groups. The origin of muscle and nerve cells were
                            important developments. None of the Ediacaran fossils had hard body parts like skeletons.

                          sudden radiations or mass extinctions of new species. These bursts of growth were often caused
                          by unexpected changes in the environment, often caused by natural disasters such as volcanic

                          The rate of origin of life appears to have increased in the Cambrian period (542-488 Ma). The
                          sudden emergence of many new species, phyla, and forms during this period is called the
                          Cambrian explosion. The biological formativeness in the Cambrian explosion was unprecedented
                          at the time and remains so today. Although Ediacaran life forms are even more
                          primitive and cannot be easily placed into any modern group, most of the late Cambrian forms
                          still form Modern phyla were already present. The development of solid body parts, such as
                          shells, skeletons, or exoskeletons, in organisms such as mollusks, echinoderms, crinoids, and
                          arthropods (a well-known group of arthropods from the lower Paleozoic are the trilobids) has
                          preserved such forms of life compared to their Proterozoic ancestors. And made fossilization
                          easier. This is why much more is known about life in the Cambrian and beyond than in
                          older epochs. The boundary between the Cambrian and the Ordovician (the latter epoch, 488-444
                          Ma) is marked by a massive mass extinction, in which some new groups disappeared
                          altogether. Some of these Cambrian groups were very large. appear complex, but they are
                          very different from modern organisms; Examples of these are Anomalocaris and Hyacousthis.

                          new places, the body size became very large. Thus, fish of increasing size arose during the
                          early Paleozoic, such as the titanic plasoderm Dunkleosteus, which may have been up to 7 m in

                          drifting apart, volcanic activity leads to the formation of more oceanic cover. Since young
                          volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than older oceanic crust, ocean levels will
                          rise during such periods. Due to this there is a rise in the sea level. Thus, in the early
                          part of the Paleozoic, large areas of the oceans were beneath the ocean floor.

                          to lift their heads out of the water to breathe. Got a chance to This would have allowed them
                          to live in water with less oxygen or to hunt smaller prey in less deep water. Later they
                          may have dared to go on land for brief periods. Eventually, some of them became so well
                          adapted to life on land that they spent their adult lives on land, although they would emerge
                          from their eggs in the water and return there to spawn. This was the origin of amphibians.
                          Around 365 Ma, another extinction occurred, probably due to a global cooling. Seeds
                          emerged from plants, which by this time (up to about 360 Ma) dramatically increased the rate
                          of their spread over land.

                            Planet Mars (symbol: ♂) is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System. The aura of
                            its bottom is bloody, due to which it is also known as the "Red Planet". There are two types
                            of planets in the Solar System - "terrestrial planets" which have a virtual surface and
                            "gaseous planets" which are made mostly of gas. Like Earth, Mars is also a planet with a
                            terrestrial surface. Its atmosphere is sparse. Its surface is reminiscent of the Moon's
                            craters and Earth's volcanoes, valleys, deserts and polar ice caps. The highest mountain in
                            the Solar System, Olympus Mons, is located on Mars. Also, the largest Canyon Valles
                            Marineris is also located here. Apart from its geographical features, the rotation period
                            and seasonal cycles of Mars are similar to those of Earth. The possibility of having life on
                            this planet has always been hypothesized.

                            Until the first flyby of Mars by Mariner 4 in 1965, it was believed that liquid water could
                            exist on the surface of the planet. This was based on periodic reports of light and dark
                            striations. In particular, at polar latitudes, which when elongated look like seas and
                            continents, dark striations have been interpreted by some observers as irrigation canals of
                            water. The existence of these straight lines could not be proved later and it was believed
                            that these lines are nothing but optical illusion. Nevertheless, of all the planets in the
                            Solar System, apart from Earth, Mars is considered to be the most important option for life
                            extension.

                            Mars is currently orbited by three operational spacecraft Mars Odyssey, Mars Express and the
                            reconnaissance Mars Orbiter, more than any other planet in the Solar System except Earth.
                            Mars has two exploration rovers (Spirit and Opportunity), the lander Phoenix, as well as
                            several inactive rovers and landers that have either failed or completed their missions.
                            Geological evidence collected by them or their predecessors indicates that there was once a
                            large amount of water on Mars, as well as indications that small hot water fountains have
                            erupted here in recent years. Findings from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor have provided
                            evidence that the south polar ice caps are receding. NASA has sent the Perseverance rover to
                            Mars in 2020, with the InSight miniaturist looking forward to its first extraterrestrial
                            flight, expected to reach Mars in early 2021.

                            Mars is about half the diameter of Earth. It is less dense than Earth, having 15% of Earth's
                            volume and 11% of mass. Its surface area is only slightly less than the total dry land of
                            Earth. Although Mars is larger and more massive than Mercury, Mercury has a higher
                            density. As a result, the surface gravitational pull of both the planets is almost the same.
                            The reddish-orange color of the Martian surface is due to iron oxide (ferric oxide),
                            commonly known as hematite or rust. It may also appear as butterscotch, and other
                            common surface colours, These include browns, golds and greens depending on the minerals.

                            primarily of tholeitic basalt, although these parts are more silica-rich than typical
                            basalt and may be similar to andesitic rocks or silica glass present on Earth. Areas of low

                            concentrations higher than normal of flaky silicates and high silicon glasses. Parts of the
                            southern highlands contain detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxene. Localized
                            concentrations of hematite and olivine have also been found. Much of the surface is
                            deeply covered by fine grains of iron oxide dust.

                            Like Earth, this planet has also undergone planetary differentiation, resulting in a denser,
                            metallic core region dominated by less dense material. Current models of the planet's
                            interior, approximately 1794 ± 65 km radius represents a core region, composed mainly of

                            mantle that created many of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but now
                            appears to be inactive. In addition to silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the
                            crust of Mars are iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. The planet's crust has
                            an average thickness of about 50 km, with a maximum thickness of 125 km. Relative to
                            the size of both planets, Earth's crust averages 40 km, which is comparable to that of Mars.

                          Although there is no evidence of a current structural global magnetic field on Mars,
                          observations indicate that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized and that this
                          gradual polarization reversal of its dipole field has occurred in the past. The properties of
                          magnetized susceptible minerals, as obtained from magnetic studies, are very similar to those
                          of successive bands found on Earth's ocean floor. One theory, published in 1999 and re-tested
                          in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that the stripes reflect plate
                          tectonics on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary magnetic system developed.
                          stopped working and the planet's magnetic field faded away.

                          During Solar System formation, Mars was formed as a result of a probabilistic process. Mars
                          has many unique chemical characteristics because of its position in the Solar System. Elements
                          with relatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur, are more common
                          on Mars than on Earth; These elements were likely removed from regions close to the Sun by the
                          solar wind energized by young stars.

                          After the planets formed, all were subjected to the so-called "primordial heavy bombardment"
                          (LHB). About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era,
                          while much of the rest of the surface has probably been eroded by impact basins created by
                          those events. There is evidence of a massive impact basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars,
                          measuring 10,600 km by 8,500 km, or roughly the south pole of the Moon—four times larger than
                          the Aitken Basin discovered so far This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a
                          Pluto-sized body about four billion years ago. This event is thought to be the cause of the
                          Martian hemispheric paradox, which created the flat borealis basin that covers 40% of the
                          planet.

                            Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During pole winter, it remains in constant darkness,
                            freezing the surface and causing the deposition of 25-30% of the atmosphere in layers of CO2
                            ice (dry ice). Exposed to light, the frozen CO2 sublimates, creating strong winds that
                            sweep the poles at speeds of up to 400 km/h. These weather actions transport large amounts
                            of dust and water vapor, which give rise to frost and large clouds like those on Earth. The
                            water-ice clouds were imaged by Opportunity in 2004.

                            The polar caps at both the poles are mainly made of water-ice. Frozen carbon dioxide only
                            accumulates in the northern winter as a relatively thick layer of about one meter on the

                            thick. The north polar cap has a diameter of close to 1,000 km during summer, and
                            contains about 1.6 million cubic km of ice, which if spread evenly over the cap would be 2
                            km. (This is equivalent to a volume of 2.85 million cubic km of the Greenland Ice
                            Sheet), the south polar cap has a diameter of 350 km and a thickness of 3 km. The total
                            amount of ice in the south polar cap and adjacent layered deposits has been estimated at 1.6
                            million cubic km. Both polar caps display spiral troughs, which have been detected by
                            recent ice-penetrating radar observations. Shallow radar sounding instrument (SHARAD)
                            analysis has shown that they are a result of downwind winds and spiral due to the Coriolis

                            Seasonal snow cover in some areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of a 1
                            meter thick transparent layer of dry snow on the ground. With the arrival of spring, the sun
                            warms the subsurface and vaporized CO2 builds up pressure from beneath the layer, rising up
                            and eventually breaking it. This process leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 mixed with
                            black basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, has been observed to occur in space for
                            days, weeks or months, and is a rather unusual rate of change in geology—particularly for
                            Mars. In place of the geysers, gas beneath the crust rushes rapidly, carving a spider-like
                            pattern of radial channels inside the ice. NASA discovered that on Mars
                            Water is found.[citation needed]

                            Although better remembered for mapping the Moon, Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer
                            were the first "aerial photographers". Most of the surface features of Mars were stable,
                            they began to lay the groundwork and determine the rotation period of the planet more
                            precisely. In 1840, Mädler drew the first map of Mars after ten years of joint observations.
                            Instead of giving names to the different topographies, Mädler and Beer simply designated
                            them with letters; Thus the meridian inlet (sinus meridian) was the figure "a".

                            Today, the features of Mars are named from a variety of sources. The albedo figures are
                            named after classical mythology. Craters larger than 60 km (37 mi) are named after late
                            scientists or writers or others who have contributed to the study of Mars. Craters smaller
                            than 60 km are named after cities and villages in the world that have a population of less
                            than a million. Larger valleys are named after stars in different languages, and smaller
                            ones are similarly named after rivers.

                            Large albedo features have been retained under many of the old names, but often they are
                            removed and renewed according to new knowledge of the nature of the features. For example,
                            Nix Olympica ("the snow of Olympus") became Olympus Mons (Mount Olympus). The surface of
                            Mars is divided into two types of regions with different albedos (as seen from Earth Went).
                            The plains, covered with sand and dust rich in bloody iron oxide, were named Arabia Terra
                            (Land of Arabia) or Amazonis Planaceae (Plain of the Amazon). These plains were once thought
                            to be the 'continents' of Mars. The dark figures were thought to be the ocean, hence their
                            names Meyer Erythraeum, Meyer Sirenum, and Aurora Sineus. The largest dark feature as seen
                            from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum. The permanent northern polar ice cap is named Planum
                            Boreum, while the southern cap is called Planum Australe.

                            Mars' equator is defined by its rotation, but its prime meridian was determined by the
                            choice of an arbitrary point, much like Earth's Greenwich; Mädler and Beer selected a line
                            for their first map of Mars in 1830. Access by the spacecraft Mariner 9 in 1972 provided
                            comprehensive images of Mars, followed by a small crater (now called Eyrie-Void) located in
                            the sinus meridian ("central gulf" or "meridien gulf") of the original election. 0.0°
                            longitude was chosen to coincide with the definition.

                            Since there is no ocean on Mars, there is no 'sea level' and a zero-elevation surface had to
                            be selected as the reference level; It is also called the areoid of Mars, analogous to
                            the terrestrial geoid. Zero altitude is defined as the height at which there is an
                            atmospheric pressure of 610.5 pascals (6.105 mbar). This pressure corresponds to the
                            triple point of water and is equal to sea level surface pressure on Earth (0 .006 atm).
                            In practice today, this surface is defined directly from satellite gravity measurements.

                          in 2008 provided evidence for a theory proposed in the 1980s that, four billion years ago, an
                          object one-tenth to two-thirds the size of the Moon struck the northern hemisphere of Mars. If
                          valid, this would have created the northern hemisphere of Mars, the site of which is a 10,600
                          km long and 8,500 km wide impact crater, roughly the combined area of Europe, Asia and
                          Australasia. In terms of area, surprisingly the South Pole-Aitken Basin is the largest impact

                          pale gray shape. Which is visible from the Earth. Due to the relatively small mass of
                          Mars, the probability of an object colliding with this planet is half that of the Earth. Mars'
                          location near the asteroid belt increases the chance of being struck by debris from that
                          source. Mars is more likely to be hit by similar impacts from the short-lived comets that
                          exist within Jupiter's orbit. Despite all this, Mars has far fewer craters than the Moon
                          because Mars is smaller. The atmosphere provides protection to the planet against the impact
                          of small meteors. The morphology of some craters is such that it suggests moisture in the

                            A large canyon, Vals Marineris, is 4,000 km long and up to 7 km deep. The length of Valles

                            circumference of Mars. For comparison, the Grand Canyon on Earth is only 446 km long and
                            about 2 km deep. Valles Marineris was formed by the swelling of the Tharsis region, which
                            caused collapse of the crust in the region of Valles Marineris. Another large valley is
                            Ma'adim Valley (Ma'adim is the word for Mars in Hebrew). It is 700 km long and again much
                            larger than the Grand Canyon with a width of 20 km in some places and a depth of 2 km. It is
                            likely that Ma'adim Vallis was formerly submerged by liquid water.

                            Our recent understanding of planetary habitability favors planets that have liquid water on
                            their surface. Planetary habitability is the ability of a planet to develop and sustain
                            life. Its main requirement is that the planet's orbit lie within the habitable zone, for
                            which the Sun currently extends this range from just beyond Venus to approximately the
                            semi-major axis of Mars. Mars dips within this region during these periods, but the
                            planet's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere protects liquid water over large areas from these
                            extended periods. The former flow of liquid water indicates the planet's potential for
                            habitability. Some recent evidence has suggested that some water on the surface of Mars may
                            have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.

                            Mars' lack of a magnetic field and its extremely thin atmosphere pose a challenge: the
                            planet has little heat transfer across its surface, a weak barrier against solar wind
                            attack, and insufficient atmospheric pressure to keep water in liquid form. . Mars is also
                            nearly, or perhaps completely, geologically dead; The end of volcanic activity largely
                            halted the recycling of chemicals and minerals within the planet and between its
                            surface.[106]

                            Evidence suggests that the planet was once much more habitable than it is today, but the
                            existence of life forms that once lived there remains unknown. In the mid-1970s, the Viking
                            probes conducted deliberate experiments to detect microorganisms in the Martian soil at
                            their respective landing sites, with positive results, including a temporary increase in the
                            production of CO2 from water and nutrients. . This sign of life was later disputed by some
                            scientists, resulting in continued debate, with NASA scientist Gilbert Levin asserting that
                            Vikings may have found life. In light of modern knowledge, a re-analysis of Viking data on
                            extreme forms of life has suggested that Viking tests were not sophisticated enough to
                            detect these forms of life. This test has also killed one life form (hypothetically).
                            Tests conducted by the Phoenix Mars Lander have shown that the soil has a very alkaline pH
                            and contains magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride. Soil nutrients may be capable
                            of supporting life, but life would still have to be protected from intense ultraviolet
                            light.

                            naked eyes at night. Astronomers have discovered 12 new satellites orbiting Jupiter, the
                            largest planet in the solar system. Since this discovery, Saturn has become the planet with
                            the most satellites. Jupiter now has a total of 95 satellites, while Saturn now has 145. is

                            with the mythology and religious beliefs of many cultures. The Roman civilization named it
                            after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach a relative magnitude
                            of -2.94, bright enough to cast a shadow, which makes it less than the Moon and Venus.

                            Jupiter is composed primarily of hydrogen with one-fourth the mass of helium, and may have a
                            rocky core containing heavier elements. Due to its rapid rotation, Jupiter is shaped
                            like an oblate spheroid (a sphere around the equator). Has a slight but noticeable bulge.
                            In its outer atmosphere, many distinct visible bands are visible at different latitudes,
                            which result from the different environments along their boundaries. The existence of
                            Jupiter's spectacular Great Red Spot, a giant storm, has been known since the 17th century
                            when it was first observed through a telescope. The planet is surrounded by a powerful
                            magnetic field and a faint planetary ring system. Jupiter has at least 79 (as of 2018)
                            moons. These also include the four largest moons, which are called the Galilean moons, which
                            were first discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede is the largest moon whose
                            diameter is more than that of Mercury. Here moon means satellite.

                          Jupiter's upper atmosphere is composed of 88-92% hydrogen and 8-12% helium, and note that the
                          percentage here refers to the amount of molecules. The mass of a helium atom is four times
                          that of a hydrogen atom. This composition changes when the proportion of its mass is described
                          as the contribution of different atoms. Thus the atmosphere is made up of about 75% hydrogen
                          and 24% helium by mass and the remaining one percent by mass consisting of other elements. Its
                          interior is denser, with a roughly distributed mass of 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other
                          elements. Astronomers believe that in the central part of Jupiter, hydrogen is present in the
                          form of metallic hydrogen after being crushed by fierce pressure. Jupiter's magnetic field is
                          stronger than any other planet in our Solar System, and scientists say this is due to the
                          metallic hydrogen inside Jupiter.

                          phosphine and sulphur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains frozen ammonia crystals.

                          close to the theoretical composition of the proto-solar nebula. The amount of neon in the

                            and beyond about 500 M⊕ (1.6 Jupiter masses) the interior will collapse under the force of

                            Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun and produces an
                            amount of heat within itself equal to the total solar radiation it receives. This additional

                            process. As a result of this process the planet shrinks by about 2 cm per year. Earlier,
                            when this planet was formed, it was very hot and its diameter was also twice the present

                            Jupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the planets in the Solar System, completing one
                            rotation on its axis in a little less than 10 hours, creating an equatorial bulge that is
                            easily visible from ground-based telescopes. This rotation requires 1.67 m/s2 centripetal
                            acceleration at the equator, compared to 24.79 m/s2 equatorial surface gravity, so the
                            resulting acceleration at the equatorial surface is only 23.12 m/s2. . The shape of this
                            planet is like an oblate spheroid, which means the diameter across its equator is 9275 km

                            equatorial atmosphere. The three systems of motion have been used as relative markers,

                          In 1953, the Miller-Urey experiment demonstrated that a combination of electricity and
                          chemical compounds present in the atmosphere of the proto-Earth could create organic compounds
                          (including amino acids) that could serve as the building blocks of life. A similar artificial
                          atmosphere consisting of water, methane, ammonia and molecular hydrogen, all molecules still
                          exist in Jupiter's atmosphere. Jupiter's atmosphere has a powerful vertical wind circulation
                          system, which would carry these compounds to low-lying regions. High temperatures within the
                          inner part of the atmosphere would break down these chemicals, hindering the formation of

                          It is thought that Jupiter, like Earth, is not likely to have much life, that there is only a
                          small amount of water in the atmosphere, and that a potentially solid surface deep in
                          Jupiter's interior would be subject to extraordinary pressure. In 1976, before the Voyager
                          missions, it was hypothesized that ammonia or water-based life could have developed in
                          Jupiter's upper atmosphere. This hypothesis is based on the ecology of the terrestrial ocean,
                          with a top level of photosynthetic plankton, a bottom level of plankton that is food for fish,
                          and marine predators that prey on fish.

                            pale yellow color due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Electric currents within
                            the metallic hydrogen layer are thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field,
                            which is weaker than Earth's and about one-twentieth the power of Jupiter's. The outer

                            shapes may be visible. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach up to 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph), faster

                            Saturn is classified as a gas giant because its exterior is composed primarily of gas and
                            obviously lacks a surface, although it must have a solid core. The planet's rotation
                            causes it to assume an oblate oval shape. Therefore, it is flattened at the poles and raised
                            at the equator. There is about a 10% difference between its equatorial and polar radii -
                            60,268 km versus 54,364 km, respectively. The other gas giants in the Solar System,
                            Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only
                            planet in the Solar System that is less dense than water - about 30% less. Although
                            Saturn's core is much denser than water, the planet's average specific density is 0.69 g/cm3
                            due to its gaseous atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the mass of Earth, while Saturn has
                            95 times the mass of Earth, Jupiter and Saturn together account for 92% of the total

                          Saturn has been declared a gas giant but it is not completely gaseous. The planets are
                          composed primarily of hydrogen, which becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above
                          0.01 g/cm3. This density is large enough to contain 99.9% of Saturn's mass at one radius. The

                            various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the
                            movements of Saturn.In ancient Roman mythology, Saturn (Latin: Saturnus), from which
                            the planet takes its name, was the god of agriculture. The Romans Saturnus was
                            considered the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus. The Greeks consecrated Cronus, the
                            outermost planet, and the Romans did the same. (In Modern Greek, the planet retains its
                            ancient name Cronus (Κρόνος: Kronos).)

                            Ptolemy, a Greek living in Alexandria, observed an obliquity of Saturn, which was a basis
                            for his determination of the elements of its orbit.[101] In Hindu astrology, there are nine
                            astrological objects, known as Navagrahas. Shani is one of them, known as Shani Dev, who

                            thought of them as two moons on the side of Saturn. It was not until Christian
                            Huygens used large telescopic magnifications that this assumption was disproved. Huygens
                            discovered Saturn's moon Titan, and Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other
                            moons: Orpheus, Rhea, Tethys, and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered a gap now known as the
                            Cassini Divide.

                            Uranus (symbol: ⛢), or Uranus, is the seventh planet from the Sun in our Solar System. On
                            the basis of diameter, it is the third largest planet of the solar system and on the basis
                            of mass, it is the fourth largest planet. It is 14.5 times heavier than Earth in mass and 63
                            times larger than Earth in size. On average, it is much less dense than Earth - because
                            Earth has a higher percentage of rock and other heavy matter, while Uranus has more gas.
                            That's why even after having a size sixty-three times bigger than the Earth, it is only
                            fourteen and a half times heavier than the Earth. Although Uranus can be seen with the
                            unaided eye, it is so far away and appears to be of such medium luminance that ancient
                            scholars never classified it as a planet, treating it as a distant twinkling star. On 13
                            March 1781 [[William Herschel Moin Herschel announced its discovery. Uranus was the first
                            planet to be discovered by telescope.

                            Four planets in our solar system are called gas giants, because they contain mostly gas
                            instead of soil and stone and their size is very huge. Uranus is one of these - the other
                            three are Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune. Of these, the structure of Arun is very similar to
                            that of Varuna. The atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune contain more ice than those of Jupiter
                            and Saturn - in addition to water ice, they also contain ice of frozen ammonia and methane
                            gases. That's why astronomers sometimes put these two in a category called "ice gas giants".
                            Among all the planets of the solar system, the atmosphere of Uranus has been found to be the
                            coldest and its minimum temperature has been observed at -49 Kelvin (i.e. -224° Centigrade).
                            Many layers of clouds have been seen in this planet. It is believed that at the bottom there
                            are clouds of water and at the top there are clouds of methane gas. It is also believed that
                            if somehow its center could be seen by going to the very center of Uranus, then ice and
                            stones would be found there.

                            Uranus orbits the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is about
                            3 billion km (20 KM). The intensity of sunlight on Uranus is about 1/1400 of that on Earth.
                            Its orbital elements were first calculated by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1783. Over
                            time, the number of predicted and observed orbits increased. Discrepancies began to appear,
                            and in 1841 John Couch Adams was the first to propose that the gap might be due to the
                            gravitational pull of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his independent
                            research on the orbit of Uranus. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle discovered a
                            new planet, later named Neptune, close in position to that predicted by Le Verrier.

                            Uranus has an axial tilt of 97.77°, so its axis of rotation is nearly parallel with the
                            plane of the Solar System. This gives it completely different seasonal changes unlike the
                            other major planets. The other planets can be seen spinning on the solar system plane like
                            wobbly topaz, while Uranus spins like a wobbly rolling ball. Near the time of Uranus
                            solstice, one pole is constantly facing the Sun while the other pole is away. Only a narrow
                            band around the equator experiences rapid day-night cycles, but with the Sun much lower on
                            the horizon than it does in Earth's polar regions. On the other side of Uranus' orbit, the
                            orientation of the poles facing the Sun is reversed. Each pole receives around 42 years of
                            continuous light, then spends the next 42 years in darkness. Near the time of the
                            equinoxes, the Sun is in front of Uranus's equator and gives a period of day-night cycles,
                            similar to The kind seen in most other planets. Uranus reached its most recent equinox on 7

                          One consequence of this axial tilt is that, over the average period of the year, Uranus' polar
                          regions receive a greater share of the input energy from the Sun than its equatorial regions.
                          Yet Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism responsible
                          for this is unknown. The cause of Uranus' unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty,
                          but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized
                          protoplanet collided with Uranus and caused this odd orientation. 1986 At the time of
                          Voyager 2's pass, Uranus' south pole was almost directly facing the Sun. Regardless of where
                          the planet's direction of rotation exists, its pole for identification as "south" uses the
                          definition supported by the recent International Astronomical Union. That is, the north pole
                          of the planet or satellite will be the pole which will be on top of the unchanging plane of
                          the solar system. A different convention is sometimes used, in which the north and
                          south poles of a body are defined according to the right-hand rule with respect to the
                          direction of rotation. This second coordinate system In terms, the north pole of Uranus

                          The standard model of Uranus' structure is that the planet is composed of three layers: a
                          rocky core (silicate/iron-nickel) in the center, an icy mantle in the middle, and a gaseous
                          (hydrogen/helium) outer shell The core is relatively small with 0.55 Earth masses
                          and the radius is less than 20% of the radius of Uranus, the mantle covers a large amount of
                          the planet with 13.4 Earth masses, while the upper atmosphere weighs 0.5 Earth masses. It is
                          relatively thin and extends to 20% the radius of Uranus's edge. The density of
                          Uranus's core is around 9 g/cm3, with a density of 80 million bars (800 Giga Pascal) and a
                          temperature of about 5000 Kelvin. The ice mantle is not actually composed of ice in
                          the traditional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid composed of ammonia, water, and other
                          volatile substances. This fluid has a high electrical conductivity, sometimes called
                          a liquid-ammonia ocean. The composition of most of Uranus and Neptune is much thinner
                          than that of Jupiter and Saturn. are distinct, the gases are dominated by ice, thus justifying
                          their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionized water, where
                          water molecules have broken up into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deep below that
                          there is sperionic water, in which the oxygen crystallizes but the hydrogen ions do not react
                          with the oxygen. Moves around freely within the reticular structure.

                          Although the model is considered to be reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models
                          also satisfy the observations. For example, if sufficient amounts of hydrogen and rocky
                          material are mixed into the ice mantle, the total amount of ice in the interior will be
                          reduced and the amount of rocks and hydrogen will likewise become greater. Currently available
                          data do not allow science to determine which model is correct. Uranus's fluid-rich
                          interior means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually dissolves into
                          the inner liquid layers. For convenience, a rotating oblate spheroid has been determined
                          at the point at which the atmospheric pressure is equal to 1 bar (100 gPa) and is also
                          referred to as a Designated as "Surface". Its equatorial and polar radii are 25,559 ± 4 and
                          24,973 ± 20 km, respectively. It will be used in this article as a zero point for surface

                            0.075 This is less than Earth's internal heat flux of about 100 W/m2. The lowest
                            temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 Kelvin (-224 °C), making Uranus the
                            coldest planet in the Solar System.

                            One hypothesis for this anomaly suggests that when Uranus was struck by a giant impact body,
                            causing the expulsion of most of Uranus's primordial heat, this heat was left with a
                            depleted core temperature. Another It is hypothesized that some kind of barrier exists
                            in the upper layers of Uranus that prevents heat from the core from reaching the surface.

                            Prior to Voyager 2's arrival, no measurements of Uranus's magnetosphere had been made, so
                            its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, astronomers expected Uranus's magnetic field to
                            line up with the solar wind, after which it coincided with the planet's poles, which lie in
                            the ecliptic.

                            Voyager observations showed that Uranus' magnetic field is unique for two reasons, first
                            because it does not originate from the planet's geometric center and second because it is
                            tilted 59° to the rotational axis. In fact, This magnetic dipole has shifted from
                            the planet's center toward the south rotational pole by at most one third of the planetary
                            diameter. This unexpected geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where
                            the magnetic field strength at the surface in the southern hemisphere is as low as 0.1 Gauss
                            (10 µT), similarly in the Northern Hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1 Gauss (110 µT).

                            Earth's magnetic field is strong roughly at both poles and the 'magnetic equator' is roughly
                            parallel with its geographic equator.

                            approximately thirty times farther from the Sun than Earth. Neptune takes 164.79 years to
                            make one complete revolution around the Sun, meaning one Neptune year is equal to 164.79

                            without ever seeing it, and which was then discovered on that basis. This happened when some
                            strange disturbances were found in the orbit of Uranus, which could only mean that an
                            unknown neighboring planet was exerting its gravitational influence on it. After research in
                            astronomy, this unknown planet was first seen through binoculars on 23 September 1846 and
                            was named "Neptune". Belongs to the deity "Varun", hence this planet is called Varuna in
